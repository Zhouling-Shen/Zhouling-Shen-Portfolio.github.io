								I want to introduce the project I have done in my software engineering class in my junior year. 
										This was the first time I learned about creating a web app. 
										This project was designed for 2-3 grades of students to practice some math problems and improve their math skills. 
										I was in a team in which everyone was responsible for a certain part of this entire project. 
										We work together and all contribute to the same goal during which 
										we have built self-learning skills, teamwork skills, and communication skills.

									<p>The another complishment I want to introduce is a python project
										 I have completed during my Business IT class.
										 The purpose of this project was to analyze
										some data from different airlines and  
										figure out which airline provides the safest service for people. During this assignment, I have learned to use some coding
										skills to deal with some business probelms. This assignment did give me a good idea how business and computer science combine 
										with each other.

				 This is a website that includes users creating accounts, sign in, completing evaluation quizzes. I 
				 was responsible for the font-end. HTML/CSS/JavaScripts was used to create the front-end pages.

			<p>The another complishment I wanted to introduce is a Excel VBA project 
				that I created in my advanced Excel class. This project was for creating 
				a Macro in Excel and calculating total ticket costs in which the program will ask users about what's the familt name, how many
				adults and children will attend a certain event, and if they need to buy endless drinks. Based on 
				the input box results that users give, the system will automatically calculate 
				the total ticket costs and drinks costs, as well as generating a parking permit for the family.
